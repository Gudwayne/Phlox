                <h1>How it all Started</h1>
                <p>Social media has revolutionized the way people communicate
                    and interact with each other. With the increasing availability of
                    smartphones and the internet, people can now access social media platforms anytime and anywhere.
                    While social media has brought several benefits, such as connecting people with friends and family,
                    it has also created some negative impacts. One of the significant negative impacts of social media
                    is that it keeps people indoors and unproductive. In this blog post, we will explore how social
                    media
                    affects people's productivity and keeps them indoors.

                <h1>Impact of Social Media on Productivity</h1>
                <p>One of the most apparent impacts of social media on productivity is the amount of time people spend
                    on it. According to a study by Digital Information World, people spend an average of 2 hours and 24
                    minutes per day on social media. This amount of time is significant, and it can negatively affect
                    people's productivity, especially if they spend this time during their working hours. Instead of
                    focusing on their work, people tend to get distracted by social media notifications, messages, and
                    posts, leading to a decline in their productivity.

                <h1>Impact of Social Media on Physical Health</h1>
                <p>Another impact of social media on people's productivity is the effect it has on their physical
                    health. Social media can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where people spend long periods sitting in
                    front of their screens. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to several health problems, such as
                    obesity, back pain, and eye strain, which can affect people's productivity negatively. Moreover,
                    spending long periods indoors can lead to a lack of exposure to sunlight, which can affect people's
                    mental health and well-being.</p>

                <!-- <h1>Impact of Social Media on Physical Health</h1> -->
                <p>In conclusion, social media has several negative impacts on people's productivity, keeping them
                    indoors and unproductive. Spending too much time on social media can lead to distractions,
                    addiction, and procrastination, which can significantly affect people's productivity. Additionally,
                    social media can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and physical health problems, which can also
                    negatively impact productivity. Therefore, it is essential to limit the amount of time spent on
                    social media and use it mindfully to maintain productivity and well-being.</p>
